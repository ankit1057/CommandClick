### Auto exec script

`Command Click` have auto exec script. This is used when `index mode` startup or end.

### Startup script
1. This script is automaticaly executed when `index mode` startup.
But, in default, `onAutoExec` in setting variable is `OFF` so, if you enable this, you must be `ON` (reference to [add-DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#add)
).

### Button exec script

This script is executed when history buton click or long click, if you select  `urlHistoryOrButtonExec` to `BUTTON_EXEC` in setting variable.
Also whether click or long click torigger, due to `historySwitch` setting  (reference to [add-DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#add)
).


### Developer page

-> [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md)

`CommandClick` is powered by javascript mainly. For that, This has many javascript interface and option.
These enforce browser feature like addon. If you had made nice script, `Commandclick` is more suitable browser for you. 
I mean, `CommandClick` is customize browser.
And, `CommandClick` is multi application. Beyond addon field, `CommandClick` is multiple standalone application(I call `fannel`).  
I mean, `CommandClick` is low code tool. You can make andorid application by less effort.  
Welcome to above developer page that expands depending on you.  


### Commandclick-repository

-> [CommandClick's fannel repository](https://github.com/puutaro/commandclick-repository)

`fannel` is ComamndClick using script (javascript, and shellscript)
For instance, your click script in CommandClick. One thing I can say that CommandClick is developed for the purpose of changing javaxcript and shellscript to gui appication. That applies to click script. It's so called Gui application. We can say so. I call the gui application `fannel`




### Generally TroubleShooting  

- When url load slow in different than before, probably due to cache, so click it's url from `url history`.
    - In many cases, occur in google search result page.


- Ocationaly first start proccess crush, try, don't worry, just reboot.  
    - Becuase app resoruce prefetch is busy, it's occur. Therefore, it' s instant problem. Rarely happens after the second time.

- When `websearch suggest` is not working, press space. if suggest  exist, fly.  
    - Prabably due to `AutovompleteTextView`'s specification.  　　
    
- When frequently crush, your smartphone reboot, or `onAdBlock` setting variable set `OFF`  
    - Becuase of low memory, as a side note when `onAdBlock` is `ON`, `CommandClick` make block list on activiry reboot. Therefore 
Crashes easily when memory is low    

- When `fannel` suddenly not working, update latest `CommandClick` and `fannel`.
    - `CommandClick` and `fannel` is new baby. Therefre, these is frequetly updated without backwards compatible.　I continuly enforce usability and fanctionality. Before long, if these grow up adult, I weight stability. But, please feel at ease, most often even now, latest version works fine.
