### Index mode

This mode is not owned existing browser. Only `CommandClick` have special feature.   
`CommandClick` advantage start from this feature.  
Thanks to this index mode, `CommandClick` have wide spread multiple feature.  
So called `main mode` for `CommandClick`.

### Change app dir

In here, talk `CommandClick`'s mechanizm.  
`CommandClick`'s adopt file system.   
You first locate `document`/`cmdclick`/`appDir`/`default`.   
In this, directory bellow `appDir` is `app directory`    
Origin isthat this directory have many android aplication(`fannel`) made by `CommandClick`.  
Threfore, `CommandClick` mangage this `app directory`.  
More precisely, `app directory` manager can do CRUD about `app directory`  
Bigginer may not edit `app directory`, but, this feature may be important for some people.

This feature is not simple shortcut like existing web browser.  
This is different from Web browser's shortcut. Than existing one, this is more thick disposition as app maker feature.　  
`ComamndClick` is app maker. `CommandClick` produce `fannel`.   
As previously mentioned, `fannel` is `CommandClick` support android aplication made by javascript and shellscript.  
So, `Create shortcut` feature is shortcut for `fannel`.  
In `CommandClick`, even `index mode` is `fannel`. In fact, `index mode` is android application made by `CommandClick`.  
Also, `Create shortcut` itself  is apeared in othre area. It's is　that you will notice as you use.  
Shortly, `Create shortcut` feature is `CommandClick`'s nature as an app maker comes to the fore.

 [detail](https://github.com/puutaro/commandclick-repository#desire)


This feature is great feature.  
`fannel` is application script for `CommandClick`. 
It is android aplication or addon.  
You can get that `CommandClick` assets without efforts like google play store.  
This feature ui is easy to see, so you can easily tell what kind of fannel it is.  
I create this feature for support `CommandClick` multiple function.  
Each `fannel` has no dependencies, so you don't have to know anything. Privilege to install what you want and as much as you want.  



1. Long press right bottom gear button

### Config

You can setting `CommandClick` Configration.
This feature is set global. 
Shotly, if only you set config, it's setting share `app direcoty`s.   
Of course, enable override setttings by `startupScript` in `app directory`.  
But, You set in this, you are released duplication setting.  
For example, if you set `onAdBlock` setting,  no need to set each `app direcotry`.
We would like you to experience the joy of using the app in a unified way.　　


- detail setting reference [add-DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#add)

1. Long press right buttom gear button  
2. Click `setting` -> "config" in popup menu


### Termux Setting

As a matter of fact, `CommandClick` start from shellscript client.  
You can see that by looking at the [cmdclick](https://github.com/puutaro/cmdclick)  
Therefore, conbination with `termux` may be said `CommandClick` native ability.  
As you use it, you will understand that `CommandClick` has golden conbination with `termux`.  
That's why CommandClick and termux are so compatible.  
Although currently `CommandClck` development stream main area is around javascript, historycaly `CommandClick` is developed for `termux`.  　　
Do you know termux gui client application?
This question is answer.  
`CommandClick` is few `termux gui client` in android application, and this feature is existing browser absolutly no having.  
Combining `CommandClick` and `termux` would have unimaginable versatility. In fact, the scale is too big for me to imagine.  
`termux` has a wealth of shell assets and an overview of each programming language.   
`CommandClick` has enforced javascript interface. 
These combinations will create endless apps for you.  


1. long press right bottom setting button  
2. `setting` -> `termux setup`   
3. Long press on termux
4. Click paste popup on termux  
5. Continue pressing `Enter` on termux
- clipboard contents:
   ```sh.sh
   pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y \
   && yes | termux-setup-storage \
   && sed -r 's/^\#\s(allow-external-apps.*)/\1/' -i "$HOME/.termux/termux.properties" 
   ```

   - reference
      - [`RUN_COMMAND` Intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent)  
      - Enable `allow-external-apps` [detail](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent#allow-external-apps-property-mandatory)
      - Add Storage permission. [detail](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent#storage-permission-optional)
      - Execute `termux-setup-storage` on termux

4. Set storage access again in `android 11` (Optional)

> You may get "Permission denied" error when trying to access shared storage, even though the permission has been granted.
>  
> Workaround:
>
> Go to Android Settings --> Applications --> Termux --> Permissions
> Revoke Storage permission
> Grant Storage permission again

[detail](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-setup-storage)

5. Set `Draw Over Apps permission` in `android 11+` (Optinal)

> You can grant Termux the Draw Over Apps permission from its App Info activity:
> `Android Settings` -> `Apps` -> `Termux` -> `Advanced` -> `Draw over other apps`.

[detail](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent/06f1de1b262d7612497e76463d8cc34ba7f49832#draw-over-apps-permission-optional)

- When above method cannot settle down, `CommandClick` or `Termux` restart, and system reboot.


### Edit startup

This feature can be replaced that just edit startup script file by `edit feature`.    
However, the startup script is buried. CommandClick automatically places frequently used scripts at the bottom position where it is easy for users to see them, but startupScripts themselves are rarely used directly, so they are buried deep inside.　　
You don't need it unless you don't mind searching, but apps are there to make life easier. That's why I prepared this function.　　
With this feature, you can trigger a specific visible position at any time to edit your `startupScript`.  
This is more easy.    
`sttartup script` is important setting item in `app directory`.    
So this feature is even more useful.   
Details of the `startup scrpt` can be found [here](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/USAGE.md#startup-script), so please take advantage of it.  


1. Long press right buttom gear button  
2. Click `edit_startup` in popup menu


### No scroll save url

`ComamndClick` memory scroll y position.  
Different from existing browsers,　It is saved for a certain period of time.  
I mean, `CommandClick` can restore not only url history but also scroll position. 
Threfore, even if you closed url, `CommandClick` resotre past state.  
In fact, this enable up to 50 domain possible.  
Aside from whether there are many or few of them, it was not good to be remembered by amazon, news sites, etc., so I prepared this function.  
We recommend that you register the site where the scroll position is remembered badly.  
By the way, the acquisition of the domain is done automatically on the `CommndClick` side, so feel free to use it.  


1. Long press right buttom gear button  
2. Click `no scroll save url` in popup menu


### Term reflesh

You can reflesh `web terminal view`.

1. Long press right buttom gear button  
2. Click `setting` -> "term_reflesh" in popup menu


### Forward

You can forward `web terminal view` history.

1. Long press right buttom gear button  
2. Click `left allow button`
   

### Search mode

This feature is `CommandClick` special feature.  
 `CommandClick` can search regardless of web or terminal.  
 Shortly you can search `web terminal view` freely.  
 You can search web site text, terminal text, and `fannel`.  
Moreover, you can switch between them depending on the situation.   
Moreover, it enable by one button.  
So, by only one button, you can controll versatile search system.  
This is `internet button`  
This corner descript about this.  


1. Input bottom search bar.

#### Launch web menu

This is shortcut menu with internet button.
When you look website, press internet button no highlight, launch menu by inernet button script

1. Click internet button.

<img src="https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/assets/55217593/c6e61be7-bfb2-4b8d-a13f-3d985d42d052" width="400">  


#### Highlight search

This mode is web browser search revolution.  
Existing browser don't have this feature.  
This mode is `CommmandClick`'s web search big advantage.
This mode enable speedy search and derailment search.  

1. Highlight text in website
2. Click internet button


<img src="https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/assets/55217593/bb4824ea-da17-43a8-bfc9-c1443d031b92" width="400">  

#### Highlight search dialog feature
  
Highlight search inpact source is this feature.   
More precisely, thanks to shortcut button power.   

**click** 

<img src="https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/assets/55217593/a2c2cf37-fbeb-49d4-8c5b-80324d2ffffc" width="400">  

    
**long press**  

<img src="https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/assets/55217593/b8a9dc77-f533-469a-8d63-59cb5b4ecfd1" width="400">  



### Startup script

This script is not script, but setting file.  
`CommandClick` is setting file each `app directory`.  
That is this "`setting file`.  
If you want to set to be diffrent from config setting, recomend override this setting.  
Additionaly, I recomend set billow setting   

- `srcImageAnchorLongPressMenuFilePath`  
- `srcAnchorLongPressMenuFilePath`  
- `imageLongPressMenuFilePath`  

Above setting item is not variable, but setting name.  
Some `CommandClick`'s `fannel` support long press menu.  
Shortly, you add `fannel` to long press menu.  
`CommandClick` is not a forced browser, but user customise oriented browser.  
I aim to make it possible to rework most of CommandClick's functionality if you feel like it.  
`CommandClick` is "open browser" in that sense.  
With a view to that point, this startup setting file (no script) express `CommandClick`' customize power.   


### Select menu  

This feature is `fannel`.  
I aim that `CommandClick` is  user customize brower.  
I dislike forced browser.  
I think it is desirable that web browser feature is open becuase web browser is daily necessities.  
I personality like linux, becuase of enabling customize due to pick up package.  
Depending on doing, consistent UI and functionality in diffrent version.  
About browser, above same.  
Of course, thanks to addon, we can be customized to some extent.  
But, it is limited. at least the menu can't be manipulated.  
`CommandClick` enable this.  

1. With long term mode, Click right bottom gear button in order short mode.
2. Type "select" to search box.
`selectMenu.js` `fannel` apear.
4. Long press `selectMenu.js`
5. Click `edit` in context menu
6. Set "Edit menu" clicking to description button to refer to.   



### Internet Button exec script

Sorry, This is not script, but setting file.  
But, this file almost untouchable.  
This may be more suitable for adventures of those who want to tinker.  
  
This file is executed, click when internet buton is grey globle mark and long terminal mode is active.  
Therefore, it has to do with the behavior of the internet button.  
If you interest in how to internet button, it might be nice to play.  
  


### Button exec script

Uhn.., sorry for repeating, this is not script, but setting file.  
Additionaly, this file almost untouchable.  
Those who want to explore should refer to the following.  
  
This script is executed when history buton click or long click, if you select `urlHistoryOrButtonExec` to `BUTTON_EXEC` in setting variable.  
Also whether click or long click torigger, due to `historySwitch` setting  (reference to [add-DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#add)
).  
  
  
### Developer page

-> [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/puutaro/CommandClick/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md)

`CommandClick` is powered by javascript mainly. For that, This has many javascript interface and option.
These enforce browser feature like addon. If you had made nice script, `Commandclick` is more suitable browser for you. 
I mean, `CommandClick` is customize browser.
And, `CommandClick` is multi application. Beyond addon field, `CommandClick` is multiple standalone application(I call `fannel`).  
I mean, `CommandClick` is low code tool. You can make andorid application by less effort.  
Welcome to above developer page that expands depending on you.  


### Commandclick-repository

-> [CommandClick's fannel repository](https://github.com/puutaro/commandclick-repository)

`fannel` is ComamndClick using script (javascript, and shellscript)
For instance, your click script in CommandClick. One thing I can say that CommandClick is developed for the purpose of changing javaxcript and shellscript to gui appication. That applies to click script. It's so called Gui application. We can say so. I call the gui application `fannel`




### Generally TroubleShooting  

- When url load slow in different than before, probably due to cache, so click it's url from `url history`.
    - In many cases, occur in google search result page.


- Ocationaly first start proccess crush, try, don't worry, just reboot.  
    - Becuase app resoruce prefetch is busy, it's occur. Therefore, it' s instant problem. Rarely happens after the second time.

- When `websearch suggest` is not working, press space. if suggest  exist, fly.  
    - Prabably due to `AutovompleteTextView`'s specification.  　　
    
- When frequently crush, your smartphone reboot, or `onAdBlock` setting variable set `OFF`  
    - Becuase of low memory, as a side note when `onAdBlock` is `ON`, `CommandClick` make block list on activiry reboot. Therefore 
Crashes easily when memory is low    

- When `fannel` suddenly not working, update latest `CommandClick` and `fannel`.
    - `CommandClick` and `fannel` is new baby. Therefre, these is frequetly updated without backwards compatible.　I continuly enforce usability and fanctionality. Before long, if these grow up adult, I weight stability. But, please feel at ease, most often even now, latest version works fine.  




### Ubuntu debian or widnows version

-> [cmdclick](https://github.com/puutaro/cmdclick)

As previously mentioned, `CommandClick` root is this.
`CommandClick`'s all start from here.  
And ubntu & windows version is critical engneer tool.  
Once you use this version, you cannot escape convenience provided by this tool.   
That's all this tool has a destructive impact.  
In fact I cannot escape, I become slave for this pc version.  
I can't help but be convenient.  
By `cmdclick` power, I was released current directory chaning type, sql table check query, git command typing, scattered url bookmark, scattered important thing's memo, and　Wandering the web in search of development tools　and more.  
Becuase `cmdclick` can controll os by shell, Control virtually everything on your PC.  
We can promise to make a "second impact" on your engineer life.  
Of course, in a happy way.
